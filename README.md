# AXK Health Mobile App

The **AXK Health Mobile App** is part of the AXK Health platform, which tokenizes user health insurance premiums, allowing users to track their token investments, manage claims, and customize coverage for beneficiaries. This mobile app offers an intuitive interface for individuals, businesses, and governments to manage health plans, monitor rewards, and process claims, all from the convenience of their mobile devices.

```

Then push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/add-claims-management
```

### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

Head over to GitHub and open a new Pull Request. The base branch should always be `main`, and your compare branch will be your feature branch (e.g., `feature/add-claims-management`).

In the PR description:
- Clearly explain the changes.
- Link to any relevant issues (if applicable).
- Provide any necessary testing instructions.

### 6. Code Review & Merging

Your code will be reviewed by a team member. If any changes are requested, make them in the same branch, and once approved, it will be merged into `main`.

### Branch Naming Conventions

## Environment Variables

Ensure that the necessary environment variables are set up for the blockchain integration and API connections. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```bash
API_URL=<your-backend-url>
CHAIN_ID=<blockchain-network-id>
AXK_TOKEN_CONTRACT=<contract-address>
```

Replace the placeholders with actual values. These environment variables are essential for interacting with the backend and blockchain.

## Code Guidelines

1. **TypeScript**: Always use TypeScript for strong typing and better code safety.
2. **Component Structure**: Keep components modular and reusable. If a component is large, break it down into smaller pieces.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components. This ensures readability across the team.
4. **Styling**: Use a consistent styling approach (e.g., Styled Components or CSS Modules) to keep the UI organized.
5. **State Management**: Use Context API or Redux to manage app-wide states such as authentication, token balances, or claims data.

---

## Testing

Before submitting your changes:

- **Run the app** on a physical device or emulator to ensure all features work as expected.
- Test **claims submission**, **token transactions**, and **multi-user roles**.
- Ensure that **beneficiary management** works smoothly, and data is stored correctly.
